## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Twenty theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-twenty)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Twenty Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install **just** the theme, you will want to do so via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install twenty

This will install the Twenty theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/twenty`.

You can find more information bout this process, including manual installation instructions, by visiting the [project page for the stand-alone Grav theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-twenty).
