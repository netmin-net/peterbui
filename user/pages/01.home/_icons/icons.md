For years I have concentrating on solutions using open source technology which allow for powerful solutions at a
fraction of a cost compared to what proprietary solutions would normally cost. I have helped many clients of the
years and delivered solutions using Platforms such as Joomla!, WordPress, Grav, Magento and Drupal.

More recently I help lead projects and a web project manager and producer, helping teams turn and deliver web projects
on time and on budget.
